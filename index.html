        <h2>AVATAR 2022</h2>
        <p>
            We're here with Avatar 2 review "The Way of Water - Back to Pandora Report". With the signature of James
            Cameron, the sequel, which came to the big screen exactly 13 years after the first film, also has the
            distinction of being the last major production of 2022. In 2006, James Cameron stated that if Avatar (2009)
            was successful, he would consider making two sequels. In 2010, he said the sequels would proceed as planned
            as a result of the film's widespread success. The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December
            2014 and 2015. He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups. Cameron planned to
            shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work "once the novel is nailed down". He stated that the sequels
            would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the
            ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for the sequel at
            the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just
            starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The
            storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be "strident" since the
            film will concentrate on entertainment. The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of
            Jake and Neytiri in December 2009. Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the
            story. In 2011, Cameron stated his intention to film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry
            standard 24 frames per second, in order to add a heightened sense of reality.

        <h2>"The Way of Water - Back to Pandora Report"</h2>
        <p>Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, “Avatar: The Way of Water” begins to tell the
            story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they
            go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure. Sixteen
            years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion of Pandora, Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omatikaya clan,
            and raises a family with Neytiri, which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, and adopted children
            Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's inert avatar) and Spider, the Pandora-born human son of the late Colonel
            Miles Quaritch. To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA, led by their new leader, Frances Ardmore, returns to
            colonize Pandora as Earth is dying. Among the new arrivals are Recombinants—Na'vi avatars implanted with
            deceased human soldiers' memories—with Quaritch's recombinant serving as the leader.
